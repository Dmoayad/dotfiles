# Dotfiles
Dotfiles configs for linux and macOS.

## Tools Required

I use stow to symlink all the dotfiles in their proper path in the system for mac and linux.

`brew install stow` 

if you use Linux you know what to do.

then inside the directory of the configs 

`stow *` for all or `stow zsh` for stowing zsh only for example.
